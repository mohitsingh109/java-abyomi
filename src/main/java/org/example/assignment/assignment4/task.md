# Java Programming Assignment: Instance Variables, Getters, Setters, and Print Method

## Objectives:
- Understand how to define and use instance variables in Java.
- Learn how to create getter and setter methods.
- Implement a method to print the details of an object.

## Instructions:

1. **Create a Class**:
    - **Class Name**: `Student`
    - **Package Name**: `org.example.assignment`

2. **Main Method**:
    - Implement the tasks within the `main` method of another class named `StudentTest`.

## Scenario:
You are tasked with developing a simple Java class to represent a student. The class should have instance variables to store the student's details, provide getter and setter methods to access and modify these details, and include a method to print the student's information.

### Tasks:

### 1. Define Instance Variables:
- Create instance variables for the following details of a student:
    - `String name`
    - `int age`
    - `String rollNumber`
    - `String course`

### 2. Create Getter and Setter Methods:
- For each instance variable, create a getter method to retrieve its value and a setter method to modify its value.

### 3. Print Details Method:
- Create a method named `printDetails`:
    - **Return Type**: `void`
    - **Functionality**: Print all the instance variable values in a readable format.

### 4. Test the Class:
- Create a `StudentTest` class with a `main` method to test the `Student` class.
- In the `main` method:
    - Create an instance of the `Student` class.
    - Set the instance variables using the setter methods.
    - Print the student's details using the `printDetails` method.
