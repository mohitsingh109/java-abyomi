# Java Programming Assignment: Control Flow and Operators

## Objectives:
- Utilize conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `if-else-if`, `switch`).
- Implement various loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- Apply relational and logical operators in conditional expressions.
- Use increment and decrement operators.

## Instructions:
1. **Create a Class**:
    - **Class Name**: `EmployeeManagement`

2. **Main Method**:
    - Implement all tasks within the `main` method of the `EmployeeManagement` class.

## Scenario:
You are developing a simple employee management system. The system needs to determine the eligibility for promotions, calculate salaries, and manage work schedules based on given conditions.

### Tasks:

### 1. Conditional Statements:
#### a. `if` Statement:
- Check if an employee's years of experience (`experienceYears`) is greater than 5.
- Print "Eligible for promotion" if the condition is met.

#### b. `if-else` Statement:
- Check if an employee's salary (`salary`) is greater than 50000.
- Print "High salary bracket" if the condition is met, otherwise print "Low salary bracket".

#### c. `if-else-if` Statement:
- Determine the performance rating based on the employee's score (`performanceScore`):
    - If `performanceScore` is greater than 90, print "Excellent".
    - Else if `performanceScore` is greater than 75, print "Good".
    - Else if `performanceScore` is greater than 60, print "Average".
    - Else print "Needs Improvement".

### 2. Switch Statement:
- Determine the type of day based on an integer variable (`dayOfWeek`) and print the corresponding type:
    - 1 for "Weekday"
    - 2 for "Weekday"
    - 3 for "Weekday"
    - 4 for "Weekday"
    - 5 for "Weekday"
    - 6 for "Weekend"
    - 7 for "Weekend"
    - Include a default case for "Invalid day".

### 3. Loops:
#### a. `for` Loop:
- Print the numbers from 1 to 10.

#### b. `while` Loop:
- Print the numbers from 10 to 1.

#### c. `do-while` Loop:
- Print the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `do-while` loop.

### 4. Relational and Logical Operators:
- Compare two employee's ages (`age1` and `age2`) using relational operators and print which employee is older.
- Use logical operators to check if an employee is eligible for a special bonus:
    - The employee is eligible if they have more than 10 years of experience and their performance score is greater than 80.

### 5. Increment and Decrement Operators:
- Use the increment operator to increase an employee's leave balance by 1.
- Use the decrement operator to decrease an employee's leave balance by 1.
